# UCLA_Final3

This final project is intended to practice regression models using the various types on the Ames Housing dataset found on the Kaggle website.
  - ridge regression
  - lasso regression
  - knn
  - decision tree
  - support vector machines

This required pre-processing the data prior to model fitting. Once the models were run, cross-validated grid search to refine three of the models. Additionally, a complexity curve for at least one attribute for each of the three models was created.

As time allowed, PCA may be run on the downloaded data to create principal component features. These PCA features can then be added as new columns of data and re-run the various regression techniques described above.
